        {
          question: "How does therapy differ from life coaching?",
          answer: "Life Coaching: Focus on goal-oriented personal growth, development, and achievement. It addresses specific life goals, career aspirations, or personal development areas. Coaches use practical strategies and tools to help clients create actionable plans and make positive changes. The main goal is to empower individuals to reach their potential and achieve specific life objectives.\n\nIndividual Therapy: Focused on addressing specific mental or emotional problems, such as anxiety, depression, trauma, or relationship issues. Therapists explore underlying emotions, patterns, and psychological dynamics. The primary goal is to understand and resolve emotional challenges, heal psychological wounds, and foster overall mental well-being."

          question: "How does couples' therapy differ from relationship coaching?",
          answer: "Couples' Therapy: Primarily focused on addressing specific problems within a relationship, from communication breakdowns to more severe issues like infidelity or substance abuse. The therapist explores underlying emotions, patterns, and dynamics that contribute to relationship problems. The primary goal is to resolve conflicts, heal emotional wounds, and foster a healthier relationship.\n\nRelationship Coaching: More goal-oriented and focuses on the present and future of the relationship rather than delving into deep-seated issues from the past. It's about enhancing the relationship, improving communication, and achieving specific relationship goals. Coaches work on practical strategies, tools, and techniques to improve relationship dynamics. The main goal is to empower the couple to develop skills, create actionable plans, and make positive changes in their relationship."
        },
        {
