                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions, affecting over 40 million adults in the United States each year. While it's normal to feel anxious occasionally, anxiety disorders involve persistent, excessive worry and fear that significantly interfere with daily activities, work, and relationships.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Unlike typical stress responses, anxiety disorders create lasting patterns of distress that don't simply go away on their own. The good news is that anxiety disorders are highly treatable, and with proper support, people can learn to manage their symptoms effectively.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  GAD involves persistent, excessive worry about various aspects of life, including work, health, finances, and family. People with GAD often find it difficult to control their worry, even when they recognize it's out of proportion to the actual threat.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Panic Disorder</h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Characterized by recurrent panic attacksâ€”sudden episodes of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms like heart palpitations, sweating, and feelings of impending doom. Many people with panic disorder develop a fear of having another panic attack.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Involves intense fear of social situations where one might be judged, embarrassed, or humiliated. This can significantly impact work, school, and personal relationships.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  CBT is considered the gold standard for anxiety treatment. It helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety. Research shows CBT can be as effective as medication for many anxiety disorders.

                  This approach gradually exposes individuals to anxiety-provoking situations in a controlled, safe environment, helping them build confidence and reduce avoidance behaviors.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Online therapy has revolutionized access to mental health care, particularly for anxiety disorders. Studies show that online CBT for anxiety can be just as effective as in-person therapy, with the added benefits of convenience, accessibility, and often lower cost.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  For many people with anxiety, the ability to receive treatment from the comfort of their own home reduces barriers to seeking help and can make therapy feel less intimidating.

                  If anxiety is interfering with your daily life, relationships, work, or overall well-being, it's time to seek professional support. Early intervention can prevent symptoms from worsening and help you develop effective coping strategies.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Remember, seeking help for anxiety is a sign of strength, not weakness. With proper treatment and support, anxiety disorders are highly manageable, and most people experience significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life.
